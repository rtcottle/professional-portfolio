      <p>
        I am a full-stack web developer that is curious about learning how web
        systems work. I find joy in seeing my efforts function in their designed
        capacity. I have been developing a variety of apps through HTML, CSS,
        and JavaScript languages. My experience so far has been very fast-paced,
        and I've been able to keep up and continue learning throughout the
        experience.
